<p><a href="https://modernfertility.com/pcos-diagnosis-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</a>&nbsp;is a hormonal condition that impacts&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/1-in-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 in 10 women</a>&nbsp;of reproductive age. While there are PCOS symptoms, such as excess androgens (often called male hormones), multiple immature&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcosaa.org/what-is-an-ovarian-cyst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follicles in the ovaries</a>, excess hair growth (aka hirsutism), unexplained weight gain, and infrequent or absent ovulation, it can be complicated to diagnose.</p>



<p>&#8220;PCOS is not one well-defined condition,&#8221; says&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/author/sharon-briggs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sharon Briggs, PhD</a>, Modern Fertility&#8217;s head of clinical product and research. &#8220;That means that what PCOS looks like can be very individual, which can lead to the condition being undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Because of this, we hosted a digital meetup to tackle the must-knows about PCOS and answer the biggest questions people have about the condition. Here, we recap the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMbtcFBQXuY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PCOS Digital Meetup</a>&nbsp;with Dr. Briggs.</p>



<p>After you’re done reading the recap (and watching the video at the end if you want even more knowledge), you’ll have the answers to these Q’s:</p>



<ul><li>What is ovulation and how is it impacted by PCOS?</li><li>How does PCOS diagnosis happen?</li><li>Do you need to see a specialist for PCOS, or can your primary care physician treat it?</li><li>Why do some people get PCOS and others don&#8217;t?</li><li>Is there a connection between thyroid issues and PCOS?</li><li>Does age impact PCOS?</li><li>What can you do to get proactive about your reproductive health if you’re thinking about trying to conceive in the future?</li></ul>

<h2 id="what-is-ovulation-and-how-is-it-impacted-by-pcos">What is ovulation and how is it impacted by PCOS?</h2>



<p><a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovulation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ovulation</a>&nbsp;is a phase of the menstrual cycle that comes after a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) — causing a mature egg follicle to burst and release an egg into the fallopian tube. In order for fertilization to happen, sperm needs to arrive on the scene within 12-24 hours. Ovulation typically happens 14 days before the start of your period.</p>



<p>One of the symptoms of PCOS is high androgen levels. This&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/hormone-imbalance-test-for-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hormonal imbalance</a>&nbsp;interferes with ovulation, resulting in irregular or absent periods, which make it difficult to ascertain if and when ovulation has occurred. &#8220;The infrequent and unpredictable nature of ovulation in women with PCOS is one of the challenges when trying to get pregnant,&#8221; says Briggs.</p>



<p>Curious to find out if you&#8217;re ovulating? &#8220;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovulation-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ovulation predictor kits</a>&nbsp;are one way to check,&#8221; says Dr. Briggs. &#8220;Checking your&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/fams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basal body temperature</a>&nbsp;is another way, and some women track their&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/cervical-mucus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical mucus</a>&nbsp;and look for changes that can signal ovulation.&#8221;</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re on&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovulation-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">birth control pills</a>&nbsp;to treat symptoms of PCOS, you might experience what&#8217;s known as withdrawal bleeding, which is what happens when you take the inactive, or placebo, pills. It&#8217;s not your period, and it doesn’t mean ovulation took place. &#8220;It&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/period-optional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not an absolute requirement that women have a period</a>&nbsp;every month,&#8221; says Dr. Briggs. &#8220;However, it can become a problem if the uterine lining continues to grow, which can put women with PCOS at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23624028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased risk</a>&nbsp;for endometrial cancer.&#8221;</p>



<p>You can be on certain forms of birth control and still ovulate, clarifies Briggs. &#8220;Women using the&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-the-iud-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copper IUD</a>&nbsp;do ovulate because it doesn&#8217;t contain hormones. Some women on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/minipill/about/pac-20388306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progesterone-only birth control</a>&nbsp;also ovulate.&#8221; If you&#8217;re not on birth control and you get a regular period, that&#8217;s a good indication that you&#8217;ve ovulated.</p>



<p>But if you’re not ovulating… do you “save” your eggs?&#8221;Every month, 500-1,000 eggs disintegrate from the&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovarianreserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian reserve</a>&nbsp;pool,” says Dr. Briggs. “And that’s true whether you’re ovulating or not.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="how-does-pcos-diagnosis-happen">How does PCOS diagnosis happen?</h2>



<p>PCOS is diagnosed via the&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/pcos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotterdam criteria</a>, which looks for the presence of two out of three symptoms: hyperandrogenism (high levels of &#8220;male&#8221; hormones like testosterone), ovulatory dysfunction (aka irregular periods), and polycystic ovaries (enlarged, with many immature follicles surrounding the eggs). Although, it’s not as cut and dry as you might expect — &#8220;You can have a blood test that comes back normal for testosterone and still have the symptoms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">androgen excess</a>,&#8221; says Dr. Briggs.</p>



<p>There are other signs and symptoms that may also suggest PCOS but aren’t part of the Rotterdam criteria. The first is high&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/amh-anti-mullerian-hormone-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-mullerian hormone (AMH)</a>, which is often at higher levels among those with PCOS. Two others are high blood sugar and insulin resistance. Dr. Briggs explains that data suggests a relationship between these conditions and PCOS, but not all people diagnosed with PCOS have them.</p>



<p>That said: If you have PCOS but not&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/pcos-diagnosis-living-with-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insulin resistance</a>, you are at increased risk for developing it in the future. (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3475283/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metformin</a>, a medication for type 2 diabetes which lowers insulin levels and improves insulin resistance, is safe for women trying to get pregnant.) Those with PCOS are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425413/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six times more likely</a>&nbsp;to develop type 2 diabetes than those without PCOS.</p>



<h2 id="do-you-need-to-see-a-specialist-for-pcos-or-can-your-primary-care-physician-treat-it">Do you need to see a specialist for PCOS, or can your primary care physician treat it?</h2>



<p>&#8220;Not all primary care physicians and OB-GYNS are prepared to address and recognize the symptoms of PCOS,&#8221; says Dr Briggs. That being said, if you have a good relationship with your primary care physician, she advises starting there. But: &#8220;Reproductive endocrinologists are prepared to talk about PCOS — they deal with hormone imbalances as part of their day to day.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="why-do-some-people-get-pcos-and-others-don-t">Why do some people get PCOS and others don’t?</h2>



<p>The medical community is still a little fuzzy on the&nbsp;<em>exact</em>&nbsp;causes of PCOS. &#8220;We still don&#8217;t know the exact combination of lifestyle factors, genetics, and unknown [risk factors] that lead to PCOS,&#8221; says Dr. Briggs. &#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been a trend of PCOS becoming more prevalent, but it&#8217;s possible that we&#8217;ll see it becoming more common in the future.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="is-there-any-correlation-between-thyroid-issues-and-pcos">Is there any correlation between&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/thyroid-test-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid issues</a>&nbsp;and PCOS?</h2>



<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4287775/#__ffn_sectitle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2015 study</a>, there is evidence that women with PCOS are likely to have subclinical hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), which means levels of&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/thyroid-disorders-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</a>&nbsp;are slightly out of the normal range, and therefore can have an impact on the ovaries and other bodily functions.</p>



<h2 id="does-age-impact-pcos">Does age impact PCOS?</h2>



<p>1 in 10 women between ages 15 and 44 have PCOS, and while many are often&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/pcos-diagnosis-living-with-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnosed&nbsp;</a>as teenagers, it&#8217;s not always so clear cut. PCOS has variations in its characteristics, so it doesn&#8217;t look the same in everyone, and therefore,&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/2/604/2972079" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnosis can be delayed</a>.</p>



<p>PCOS does&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23624031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">change with age</a>&nbsp;(high body-fat percentage and insulin resistance are more predominant as one gets older), but it doesn’t go away. Says Dr. Briggs:&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;</strong>It&#8217;s not necessary to check in to see if you [still] have it. It’s not going to change. If you&#8217;re concerned about your symptoms, or if you feel like your symptoms are consistent with PCOS and not being addressed, check in with your doctor.”</p>



<h2 id="what-can-you-do-to-get-proactive-about-your-reproductive-health-if-you-re-thinking-about-trying-to-conceive-in-the-future">What can you do to get proactive about your reproductive health if you’re thinking about trying to conceive in the future?</h2>



<p>Staying on top of how your reproductive system is functioning (if you&#8217;re not on birth control, are you getting your period regularly?) is a good place to start, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/lifestyle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercising, eating well, and definitely not smoking nicotine</a>. &#8220;Not smoking is the number one thing you can do for your reproductive health even if you&#8217;re not thinking of conceiving,&#8221; says Dr. Briggs.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The past 30 years have been filled with significant changes in fertility patterns across the United States. We’ve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_13-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seen changes</a>&nbsp;in when we have kids, how many kids we have, and even how many kids we have at a time (i.e., the prevalence of twins and higher-order births). The highest rate of twinning (33.9 per 1,000 live births) ever recorded was in 2014, while the highest rate of triplets and higher-order births (a whopping 193.5 per 100,000 live births!) was recorded in 1998. Based on the most recent demographic data, both of these rates have since decreased (32.6 per 1,000 live births for twins, and 93 per 100,000 live births for triplets and higher-order births).<br><br>Though most of us (correctly) think that things like in-vitro fertilization (IVF) are the main reason why multiple births are as common as they are, there’s another naturally occurring factor that deserves some time in the spotlight as well: hyperovulation, aka multiple ovulation.</p>



<p>In this post, we’ll go over what hyperovulation is, the science behind it (spoiler alert: hormones are involved), and the factors that affect its prevalence.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-hyperovulation">What is hyperovulation?</h2>



<p>Though menstrual cycles don’t look the same from person to person — and don’t even look the same across different cycles in the same person — the general pattern goes something like this:</p>



<ul><li>Your&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/fsh-hormone-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follicle-stimulating hormone</a>&nbsp;(FSH) encourages a few follicles that contain eggs to develop.</li><li>A follicular battle royale of sorts plays out, in which just one follicle (usually the most developed and largest one) survives, and all other follicles that were developing alongside it die off.</li><li>The dominant follicle continues to grow and develop.</li><li>An egg is released from the follicle during&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovulation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovulation</a>.</li><li>If the egg is fertilized and a pregnancy begins, follicle development is halted. Otherwise, the cycle of primordial follicle development starts again.</li></ul>



<p>Given that things like twins and triplets exist, we know that there must be alterations to this general schema. In the case of identical twins, a single egg gets released and once it is fertilized by sperm (we call this egg + sperm combo a zygote), it splits into two, and the result is two completely identical zygotes. Because these two originate from the same zygote, we’d call them&nbsp;<strong>monozygotic</strong>. The result? Identical twins. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of fraternal twins though, there’s a different process at play, and that’s hyperovulation. Remember how we said that in the follicular battle royale, there’s only one winner? Well, that’s not always true.</p>



<p>It’s also possible for there to be more than one follicle that emerges as the dominant one, and more than one egg released during ovulation (i.e.,&nbsp;<strong>hyperovulation</strong>). If these two genetically distinct eggs get fertilized, they’ll form two genetically distinct zygotes. Because these sorts of twins were always two separate zygotes from the start, we’d call them&nbsp;<strong>dizygotic</strong>&nbsp;(and in less sciencey terms, fraternal).</p>



<figure><iframe src="https://modernfertility.com/quiz-widget/"></iframe></figure>



<h3 id="what-s-the-science-behind-hyperovulation">What’s the science behind hyperovulation?</h3>



<p>Because&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/what-are-hormones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hormones</a>&nbsp;play a role in a million different bodily processes (not quite an exact count, but probably close!), you won’t be surprised to hear that they’re closely tied to whether you ovulate in a given cycle, and how many eggs you ovulate. Though several hormones play a role here, the star of this show is FSH.<br><br>Starting around menstruation, your body begins to produce more FSH to stimulate the development of follicles (clearly, whoever thought of the name “follicle-stimulating hormone” was feeling particularly creative that day). After about a week, FSH levels naturally begin to drop. Only the follicle that was largest and most developed is able to survive despite this FSH drop. This dominant follicle begins producing&nbsp;<a href="https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/estrogen-and-menstrual-cycle-humans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estradiol</a>, which then triggers the production of luteinizing hormone (LH), and it’s a surge in LH that ultimately makes ovulation happen.</p>



<p>But what happens if FSH levels are just naturally higher, or if they don’t drop after about a week? According to some studies, those are precisely the scenarios in which multiple ovulation could occur. Mothers of naturally occurring fraternal twins (i.e., women who naturally had hyperovulation) have been shown to have&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/83/2/481/2865358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher FSH</a>&nbsp;than mothers who did not have fraternal twins in several studies, though not all do. Mothers of fraternal twins might also&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/83/2/481/2865358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release FSH more frequently</a>&nbsp;early on in the cycle when follicles are developing. And while some studies have pointed to differences in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)02687-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how sensitive</a>&nbsp;someone’s body is to the effects of FSH as an explanation for multiple ovulation,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)04164-7/fulltext?version=printerFriendly&amp;code=lancet-site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others</a>&nbsp;haven’t found data that back this up.</p>



<p>There are two important things to keep in mind in drawing conclusions from these studies’ findings. First, they don’t give us any clinically applicable cutoffs — what we mean by that is there’s&nbsp;<strong>no single FSH level at which we can tell someone they’re definitely going to experience hyperovulation</strong>. Second, even though FSH may be associated with fraternal twinning (which is a surefire sign of multiple ovulation), that doesn’t necessarily mean that it&nbsp;<em>causes</em>&nbsp;it.</p>



<p>There are other lines of evidence that point to high FSH&nbsp;<em>causing</em>&nbsp;hyperovulation. For people who are having difficulty achieving pregnancy, it’s common to be prescribed a hormone-based medication, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1313517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Letrozole</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clomid</a>, that puts follicle development in overdrive. Though there are slight differences in the way these medications work, their end result is the same: They cause higher levels of FSH, and this higher FSH results in a higher-than-normal number of follicles reaching the developed stage.</p>



<h2 id="how-often-does-hyperovulation-happen">How often does hyperovulation happen?</h2>



<p>It’s tricky to nail down exact prevalence rates, especially when studying the prevalence of things that aren’t accompanied by observable signs, as is the case with hyperovulation. Most of the time, hyperovulation goes undetected. While&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovulation-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovulation predictor kits</a>&nbsp;(OPKs) can measure LH to tell you if you’re likely ovulating soon, those LH concentrations don’t tell you&nbsp;<em>how many</em>&nbsp;eggs you’ll be ovulating.</p>



<p>We also can’t just look at the rate of fraternal twinning and assume that it’s representative of the prevalence of hyperovulation. This is because of something that sounds like it’s straight out of a sci-fi movie, but is a real thing:&nbsp;<a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/multiples/vanishing-twin-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vanishing twin syndrome</a>.</p>



<p>This is when there are two fertilized eggs that implant into the uterine lining, with one&nbsp;<a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/multiples/vanishing-twin-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“naturally disappearing”</a>&nbsp;early on in the pregnancy. Though this phenomenon isn’t anything new, with advances in ultrasound technology and accessibility, our ability to detect so-called vanishing twins has improved. That being said, it’s likely that some women ovulate more than one egg and then multiple fertilized eggs implant in the uterine lining, but one of them &#8220;disappears&#8221; before they get their first ultrasound. Because of this, the fraternal twinning rate likely underestimates the true prevalence of hyperovulation.</p>



<p>Those caveats aside, there are some studies that include ultrasounds performed across the cycle to directly observe how common it is to ovulate more than one egg. A&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/21/6/1531/724256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2006 study</a>&nbsp;performed ultrasounds around ovulation in one to three cycles for 105 women, and found that 21% of women had at least one cycle where hyperovulation occurred.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(83)91661-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Other studies</a>&nbsp;that are a bit more dated put the prevalence of hyperovulation at closer to 10%. The wide range in reported prevalences from ultrasound-based studies means, unfortunately, we can’t be super confident about what the true population prevalence is.</p>



<h2 id="factors-associated-with-multiple-ovulation">Factors associated with multiple ovulation</h2>



<p>Though we can’t be positive about how often hyperovulation itself occurs, we can look at factors associated with FSH and fraternal twinning to roughly guess:</p>



<h3 id="age">Age</h3>



<p>There’s one factor that has been shown time and time again to be associated with FSH levels and the prevalence of naturally occurring fraternal twinning:&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">age</a>. The first reports of a link between age and twinning can be traced back to as early as the 1970s in&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tera.1420040214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a book</a>&nbsp;called “The Biology of Twinning in Man,” (apparently women didn’t deserve a shout out there&#8230;) in which the author reports a 300% increase in twinning between the ages of 15 and 37.</p>



<p>At first glance this seems to contradict the fact that&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/chances-of-conception/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fertility decreases with age</a>&nbsp;in women, so let’s take a closer look. Typically, developing follicles respond to increases in FSH by releasing hormones like&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/estrogen-low-high" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">E2</a>&nbsp;to inhibit FSH production, making hormones like E2 the brake pedal on FSH. As the number of developing follicles (and&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/amh-anti-mullerian-hormone-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-Mullerian hormone</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/amh-levels-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMH</a>, levels) decreases with age, so does the ability to act as that brake pedal and inhibit that FSH production. More FSH production is associated with a higher likelihood of more than one follicle reaching the dominant follicle stage and voila! Hyperovulation.&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/21/6/1531/724256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical ultrasound data</a>&nbsp;confirms this pattern. But keep in mind that egg quality decreases with age, meaning that though older women are significantly more likely to ovulate more than one egg at a time, it doesn’t necessarily mean that those two eggs will both be viable.</p>



<h3 id="genes">Genes</h3>



<p>Second,&nbsp;<a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/traits/twins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genes</a>&nbsp;likely play a role in hyperovulation and twinning. Unlike some animals, where there have been single genes identified that strongly affect the likelihood of fraternal twinning, the genetics of fraternal twinning and hyperovulation in humans are a little messier. Some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27132594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent studies</a>&nbsp;have found that genes linked to FSH production influence fraternal twinning rates, though like many complex traits, it’s likely that any one gene will only explain a small part of your risk.</p>



<h3 id="stopping-birth-control">Stopping birth control</h3>



<p>Because other factors potentially contributing to hyperovulation aren’t as strongly backed by data, we’ll go over them briefly. First up is recent&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/stopping-birth-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">birth control cessation</a>. Hormonal birth control methods like the&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/birth-control-pill-side-effects-effectiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pill</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/vaginal-ring-side-effects-effectiveness-and-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ring</a>&nbsp;work by suppressing your brain’s centers that signal the production of hormones like FSH, and suppressed FSH → suppressed follicular development → no ovulation. After stopping these birth control methods, your brain has to get back into its regular hormone-producing groove, and there’s a chance that in this process it’ll&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8521715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overshoot its FSH production</a>, thus making hyperovulation more likely.</p>



<h3 id="other-factors">Other factors</h3>



<p>Interesting studies are constantly popping up, linking fraternal twinning to things like height, BMI, seasonality, and even smoking. We won’t discuss them here because these associations need to be poked and prodded a bit more before we can be confident that they’re legitimate, but a summary of some of these associations can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/14/1/37/827500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h2 id="is-hyperovulation-good-">Is hyperovulation “good”?</h2>



<p>While there are many situations in which more is better than less, that’s not necessarily the case when it comes to ovulation and developing embryos. Don’t get us wrong — hyperovulation and having twins can be natural, exciting, and, frankly, more efficient for those who want to expand their families quickly!</p>



<p>Multiple births, however, are also considered&nbsp;<a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/multiples/complications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-risk pregnancies</a>&nbsp;because each additional baby is associated with a higher risk of preterm birth, gestational diabetes, and low birth weight, among other potential complications. Because of these increased risks, it’s not as simple as “more = better” when it comes to how many eggs you release during ovulation each month.</p>



<p>The more reproductive health research we do on people with ovaries, the more we learn that things don’t always follow the textbook patterns we’re taught. Hyperovulation is seen across species, populations, and across the reproductive lifespan in humans, and is associated with things like higher FSH and increasing age. Though there aren’t any tests that can tell you for sure whether hyperovulation is something you will experience,&nbsp;<a href="http://modernfertility.com/science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting insight into your hormone levels</a>&nbsp;(like FSH and AMH) may provide some initial clues about what your chances of hyperovulation may be like.</p>



<p><strong>P.S. Just for fun… a note on animal twinning rates:</strong></p>



<p>We came across this in our research and had to share: As rates of both identical and fraternal twinning are low in humans, you might be tempted to think that that’s normal across mammals and primates, our close genetic relatives. Turns out, the animal kingdom is an ever-surprising place, and there are fascinating patterns of twinning and multiple ovulation everywhere you look.</p>



<p>For example, armadillos always have four identical offspring — meaning that one fertilized egg splits and splits and splits until there are identical quadruplets. And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4138798/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marmosets</a>, which are monkeys found in South America (<a href="http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/pygmy_marmoset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some of which</a>&nbsp;weigh less than half a pound!!), always have fraternal twins. Interestingly, twinning rates in captivity for our closest living genetic relatives, chimpanzees, are around&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.7%</a>, which is eerily similar to the rate of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db80.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.9%</a>&nbsp;observed in the United States in 1980, before the popularization of procedures like IVF.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Fertility could be top of mind or on the back burner for now — but it has the power to impact everything. We’re sharing your stories to both celebrate and create space for the many ways we navigate our careers, relationships, and finances in relation to our reproductive health. If you have a story to share,&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.modernfertility.com/fertility-stories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>get in touch</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p><em>Writer and reiki healer&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nowheylady/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Jenna Schreck</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;always knew that kids were in her future. But after going through a health crisis and realizing how powerful her body really is, she has a new appreciation for her fertility.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mf-blog-staticfiles/d-compressed/ghost-prod/2020/05/placard.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>When I first went off birth control at age 24, having a kid wasn’t on my mind&nbsp;</strong>—in fact, I was actively trying not to get pregnant with my live-in boyfriend at the time<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;I was focused on figuring out what was going on with my body after experiencing some severe gut health issues. As I got more in touch with my body — learning when I was in my follicular phase and when I was ovulating — my fascination with optimizing my life around my energy levels and hormonal patterns was born. I realized how incredible my body was and my primal desire to have a baby became more forthright.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mf-blog-staticfiles/d-compressed/ghost-prod/2020/05/blog-quote.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>I had been on birth control since I was 15 or 16 because of irregular cycles and severe cramps.&nbsp;</strong>My mom had never experienced issues while taking birth control, so neither one of us thought twice about it when my OB-GYN wrote up a prescription. Up until three years ago, I never had any big issues on it, other than some bloating and mood swings when I switched brands.</p>



<p><strong>When I was 24, I had a big gut flare-up and went to the gastroenterologist.&nbsp;</strong>He ran tests and diagnosed me with IBS and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Now, I’m a Virgo, type-A overthinker who over-analyzes everything — I’m not one to make rash decisions. But I knew instinctively that the gut issues were tied to my “idiosyncratic” NAFLD and exacerbated by my birth control. I personally wasn’t comfortable taking birth control when so much other stuff was happening with my body, so I decided to go off the pill. I also tried a low-FODMAP diet and tried gaining weight — but, in the end, getting off hormonal birth control, balancing my hormones naturally, and learning about my cycle is what worked for me.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mf-blog-staticfiles/d-compressed/ghost-prod/2020/05/blog-quote2.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>Since I had been seeing a functional medicine doctor for my gut health alongside my gastroenterologist, as I decided to go off my birth control, she was able to catch imbalances as they happened.&nbsp;</strong>She discovered that I had high copper levels, which can cause issues like depression and anxiety. My liver disease also meant that it was taking longer for my hormones to regulate. My period stopped and I went through secondary amenorrhea for over nine months — which kicked off a whole journey of navigating different ways to get my reproductive system up and running again.</p>



<p><strong>I decided to test my hormones with Modern Fertility and found out that I also had a hormonal imbalance.&nbsp;</strong>This helped me understand how my body was functioning and what treatments might work best for me. I also went back to school to study nutrition. Once my gut health was under control, I started exploring other options to deal with my menstrual cycle. I eventually went to an acupuncturist, spent some time with an Ayurvedic practitioner, and became a reiki practitioner myself. I finally, finally have a normal (for me) cycle — between 29-32 days, month after month, with a two-day bleed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mf-blog-staticfiles/d-compressed/ghost-prod/2020/05/blog-quote-3.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>I believe that everything that we go through happens for a reason.&nbsp;</strong>My experience encouraged me to become a reiki healer and to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nowheylady.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share more personal aspects of my story on my blog</a>. Being able to share what happened to me has shown me how many other people are going through the same thing — and how many people need healing. Connection and healing are helpful for anyone, no matter what they’re going through. Telling my story and what’s worked for me feels really special and like I have found my calling.</p>



<p><strong>Throughout the years, I’ve learned to trust my body more than what someone else thinks.</strong>&nbsp;Now, I’m really tuned in to how I’m feeling — I know what it’s like when I feel good and when I don’t feel aligned in my body. There’s really nothing more powerful than that. I went from a place of feeling like my body wasn’t working and not understanding it to knowing why I feel the way I do every day — and having actions in place to help my body get back into balance when it feels off.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Once you decide you&#8217;re ready to start trying to get pregnant, you might find yourself googling “how to get pregnant fast.” &#8220;Anecdotally, we&#8217;ve all heard stories of women who conceive in the first month they start trying, but that doesn&#8217;t happen to most women,&#8221; says&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/medicalboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nataki Douglas, MD, PhD</a>, a reproductive endocrinologist and the chair of the Modern Fertility Medical Advisory Board.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no surefire recipe for lightning-fast conception, but there is a lot of information about how you can optimize your fertility when family planning — so when you’re ready to get pregnant, you&#8217;ll know how to proceed with confidence.</p>



<p>In our live Q&amp;A,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ylwGWsPAs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;Goodbye Dr. Google: Real Talk on Getting Pregnant With a Fertility Doctor,</a>&#8221; Dr. Douglas jumps into the nitty gritty of trying to conceive and answers all your questions. We&#8217;ve rounded them up here, so read on to find out:</p>



<ul><li>When will your period come back after stopping birth control?</li><li>Which tests and doctors should you get and see before trying to get pregnant?</li><li>What&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/lifestyle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lifestyle changes</a>&nbsp;should you make when you’re trying to conceive?</li><li>What&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/modern-fertility-guide-to-prenatal-vitamins-fertility-supplements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prenatal vitamins</a>&nbsp;should you be taking?</li><li>Is there anything you can do to increase your chances of getting pregnant?</li></ul>



<h2 id="when-will-your-period-come-back-after-stopping-birth-control">When will your period come back after&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/birth-control/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stopping birth control</a>?</h2>



<p>If you had a regular menstrual cycle before starting hormonal birth control, you might see your menstrual period return about 28-30 days after you stop taking hormonal birth control. Sometimes, though, that return can be delayed. The reason, says Dr. Douglas, is that the hormone needs to clear your body, and that happens at different times for different people.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no evidence that being on birth control for a long time results in an&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/bc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact on your fertility</a>&nbsp;(though it’s worth noting that taking&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/birth-control-shot-depo-provera-side-effects-effectiveness-and-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Depo-Provera</a>&nbsp;can delay periods for up to 22 months after stopping). If your period doesn&#8217;t make an appearance within 90 days of stopping birth control, Dr. Douglas does recommend seeing a doctor. But, she says, &#8220;It&#8217;s not always indicative of a problem.” She also recommends&nbsp;<a href="http://modernfertility.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testing your hormones</a>&nbsp;to get a better idea of why you haven’t had a period yet.</p>



<p>So how long should you wait between that last pill/implant/shot/ring and trying to conceive? &#8220;I recommend that people wait until they get a period,&#8221; says Dr. Douglas, &#8220;so we have an idea of when you got pregnant. But, besides that, there&#8217;s no real timing.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>



<p>An important reminder: Your&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">age is one of the biggest factors</a>&nbsp;when it comes to how long it takes to conceive. &#8220;We really should be considering age in our expectations,&#8221; urges Dr. Douglas.</p>



<figure><iframe src="https://modernfertility.com/quiz-widget/"></iframe></figure>



<h2 id="which-types-of-tests-and-doctors-are-important-before-trying-to-conceive">Which types of tests and doctors are important before trying to conceive?</h2>



<p>Dr. Douglas recommends scheduling a number of appointments in advance, such as a dental X-ray, a routine OB-GYN checkup (so that any&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/conceiving-with-sti/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexually transmitted infections</a>&nbsp;can be identified and treated, since untreated STIs can interfere with fertility and also increase risks during labor and delivery), as well as a general preconception visit. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great opportunity to ask questions, find out how the practice works in terms of appointments, labor and delivery, and to discuss any health concerns you might have.&#8221;</p>



<h3 id="ovulation-tests">Ovulation tests</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re not already tracking your&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovulation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovulation</a>, practicing before you go to the OB-GYN in anticipation of trying to get pregnant is a good idea.&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovulation-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ovulation predictor kits (OPKs)</a>&nbsp;not only indicate time of ovulation and when it&#8217;s time to have unprotected sex — the test will tell you when your luteinizing hormone (LH) level suggests ovulation and help you find your two most fertile days — but they can help you and your doctor get an understanding of the hormonal patterns of your cycle.</p>



<p>Also, monitoring your&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/cervical-mucus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical mucus</a>&nbsp;is a super easy way to check in with your cycle and get important knowledge about your menstrual cycle. (And it doesn’t require anything but your fingers and a glass of water!)</p>



<h3 id="hormone-tests">Hormone tests</h3>



<p>Checking in with your hormones helps you gain insight into your&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/ovarianreserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian reserve</a>&nbsp;(how many eggs you have), as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/thyroid-test-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your thyroid hormone levels</a>, which are major when it comes to achieving a healthy pregnancy. &#8220;Although knowing your hormones is not predictive of how successful you&#8217;ll be at getting pregnant in the time frame that you want,&#8221; says Dr. Douglas, &#8220;knowing what&#8217;s happening with them can give you a baseline sense of what&#8217;s going on in your body.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have to wait until you&#8217;ve stopped hormonal birth control to test your hormones — there are some fertility hormones, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/amh-levels-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-Mullerian hormone</a>&nbsp;(AMH) and thyroid hormones, like TSH and free T4 (all of which Modern Fertility can test for) that can be evaluated while you&#8217;re on BC.</p>



<p>You also don&#8217;t have to have regular periods in order for your doctor to get a look at what your hormones are up to. Random-cycle hormone testing allows you to get tested for a full panel of hormones any day (instead of only on day three of your period). &#8220;We&#8217;re specifically looking at hormones related to ovarian reserve, like&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/amh-anti-mullerian-hormone-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMH</a>.&#8221; says Dr. Douglas. &#8220;It&#8217;s a way for us to know what&#8217;s going on with your egg supply, as well as any red flags or health conditions (like&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/pcos-diagnosis-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polycystic ovary syndrome</a>, or PCOS).&#8221;</p>



<h3 id="fertility-doctors">Fertility doctors</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/finding-a-fertility-doctor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fertility specialist</a>, Dr. Douglas advises talking with your OB-GYN first about potential providers. If you don&#8217;t have an OB-GYN (for example, if you see a primary care physician instead), do your research — look into specialties and practices before calling for an appointment.</p>



<p>As for genetic testing? Dr. Douglas says that insurance often covers it when it’s in the context of treating fertility problems, but plans may differ in terms of coverage. If you have a family history suggesting increased risk of recessive genetic disorders, she recommends looking into genetic testing.</p>



<h2 id="what-lifestyle-changes-can-improve-chances-of-conception">What&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/lifestyle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lifestyle changes</a>&nbsp;can improve chances of conception?</h2>



<p>According to Dr. Douglas, these are the main lifestyle factors to look into when thinking about trying to get pregnant:</p>



<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Exercise:&nbsp;</strong>Exercise while trying to conceive and in pregnancy is beneficial. Dr. Douglas recommends finding and maintaining a routine that works for you.</p>



<p>2.<strong>&nbsp;Body weight:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/weight-bmi-fertility-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Your body weight</a>&nbsp;can impact your hormones and cause fertility challenges.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5845358/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A higher body-fat percentage can interfere with ovulation</a>, causing irregular periods and complications in pregnancy such as&nbsp;<a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-11-59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gestational diabetes</a>.</li><li>On the other hand, &#8220;Restricting yourself and eating only a few foods can also impact your overall health and your fertility,&#8221; says Dr. Douglas. She advises eating regular balanced meals, as well as limiting your exposure to processed foods and pesticides.</li></ul>



<p>3.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Endocrine disruptors:&nbsp;</strong>You should also be aware of what you&#8217;re eating and drinking on and out of. There&#8217;s evidence that a class of chemicals known as endocrine disruptors, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/bpa/faq-20058331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BPA</a>, can cause fertility issues, so using stainless steel and glass instead of plastic is a good idea before trying to conceive.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Smoking:&nbsp;</strong>Deciding to&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/vaping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stop smoking</a>&nbsp;is another big step you can take toward improving your fertility — and quitting at any point will have a positive impact.</p>



<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Alcohol:&nbsp;</strong>&#8220;Getting exact information on how alcohol impacts fertility is hard,&#8221; says Dr. Douglas. &#8220;There are many studies that show that having one or two drinks a day won&#8217;t impact fertility, but there are others that show that moderate drinking can be harmful. So, ultimately, it&#8217;s up to you to decide.&#8221;</p>



<p>6.&nbsp;<strong>Caffeine:&nbsp;</strong>&#8220;Most of the time, one cup of coffee per day is fine during pregnancy and when you&#8217;re trying to conceive,&#8221; clarifies Dr. Douglas. &#8220;If you&#8217;re drinking more than that, the sooner you start cutting back on those larger amounts, the better, so your body can get over those symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.&#8221;</p>



<p>7.<strong>&nbsp;Beauty products and procedures:&nbsp;</strong>&#8220;When you&#8217;re actively trying to conceive, we&#8217;re concerned about the chemicals that are in hair coloring entering your system,&#8221; says Dr. Douglas. Also, consumers of Botox should know that while there aren&#8217;t necessarily clear associations between the treatment and infertility, Dr. Douglas says it does depend on how much you&#8217;re using, where you’re using it, and how much you’re using.</p>



<h2 id="what-prenatal-vitamins-should-you-be-taking">What prenatal vitamins should you be taking?</h2>



<p><a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/modern-fertility-guide-to-prenatal-vitamins-fertility-supplements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily prenatal vitamins</a>&nbsp;are a must when you&#8217;re pregnant and trying to get pregnant since they reduce the chances of early miscarriage, as well as neural tube birth defects. (But don&#8217;t panic if you miss a couple of days!) Starting prenatals up to a year before conception will ensure that you have the optimum levels of vitamins in your body.</p>



<p>While there&#8217;s no particular brand that she&#8217;d suggest — generic or over-the-counter is fine — Dr. Douglas says the key is making sure the one you take has the recommended daily dose of folic acid (.4 milligrams), calcium (1000 milligrams), vitamin D (600 international units), and iron (27 milligrams). While some opt to take a prenatal containing DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, which can help with inflammation and brain health, Dr. Douglas says that’s not necessary. Similarly, while there are reasons to choose folate versus folic acid and vice versa, it&#8217;s a conversation to be had with your doctor.</p>



<p>For folks who can&#8217;t tolerate prenatal vitamins due to the size of the pill, acid reflux, morning sickness, or any other reason, Dr. Douglas recommends taking vitamins such as vitamin C separately, and making sure you&#8217;re eating well-balanced meals and taking folic acid. Iron supplements are also important — all pregnant people, regardless of blood count status before pregnancy, are at risk for developing anemia.</p>



<h2 id="is-there-anything-that-can-increase-your-chances-of-getting-pregnant">Is there anything that can increase your chances of getting pregnant?</h2>



<p>There are a lot of ideas out there about what can make you more or less likely to conceive (check out this piece about&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/does-sex-position-orgasm-affect-conception/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex positions, orgasms, and getting pregnant</a>). While you might have been told that lying down for 15 minutes after sex or using a Diva Cup will improve your chances of getting pregnant, Dr. Douglas says there&#8217;s no research that supports this.</p>



<p>You might also think that having intercourse (with a partner who has a penis) as often as you possibly can will help you get pregnant quickly, but Dr. Douglas debunks this. &#8220;While looking at sperm during fertility treatment, we&#8217;ve found that multiple ejaculations in one day aren&#8217;t all of the same good quality.&#8221; What’s most optimal? Having sex the day before and of ovulation. While we&#8217;re on the subject of sperm health, it can be negatively impacted by some lubricants — but there is&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/lube/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sperm- or &#8220;baby&#8221;-friendly lube</a>&nbsp;on the market.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s no question that a lot is up in the air right now — nearly one-third of the people we spoke to for our&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/modern-state-fertility-2020-sofi-career-money" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern State of Fertility 2020 survey</a>&nbsp;have changed their fertility or family planning decisions due to&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/coronavirus-and-fertility-heres-what-we-know-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a>.</p>



<p>Whether you’re&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/pregnancy-coronavirus-covid-19-ttc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">putting your plans for kids on hold or are ready to start trying right now</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/product/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Fertility Hormone Test</a>&nbsp;is an easy way to learn more about your body from the safety and comfort of home. (And if you’re not sure about kids or they’re in your very distant future? Your fertility hormones don’t just play a role in conception — they can also key you in to potential health conditions like thyroid disorders and PCOS.)</p>



<p>We reached out to members of our&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.modernfertility.com/modern-community-landing-page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Community</a>&nbsp;— a digital space for anyone with ovaries to connect and have unfiltered conversations about reproductive health — to understand why they decided to test their hormones at home right now. Here’s what they said.</p>



<h2 id="1-to-inform-their-decision-to-start-trying-now-or-wait-until-later">1. To inform their decision to start trying now or wait until later</h2>



<p>“My husband and I had agreed to start trying to conceive when COVID-19 and the shelter-in-place began,” says Stevie, a member of the Modern Community. “We decided to use Modern Fertility to test my hormones, so we could make informed decisions about trying to get pregnant now or waiting until we know more about COVID-19.”</p>



<h2 id="2-to-get-some-answers-safely-from-home">2. To get some answers safely from home</h2>



<p>Lena, another member of the Modern Community, plans on doing additional testing with her doctor later in June 2020, but she’s not sure how easy that will be given COVID-19’s impact on in-person appointments. She’s using the Modern Fertility Hormone Test to start collecting info, no matter when she can get to the clinic. “It feels like a safe way to get some answers without having to try to get into my doctor’s office,” she explains.</p>



<h2 id="3-to-learn-more-about-their-fertility-now-and-plan-accordingly">3. To learn more about their fertility now and plan accordingly</h2>



<p>Olivia knows that trying for kids is in her near future, so she wanted to learn all she can about her reproductive health to help with planning. She understands the realities of COVID-19, but she’s not letting that deter her from her path: “It seems like the pandemic will be around for a while, so why not take the time to learn and plan accordingly?” she says.</p>



<p>Christina is also planning ahead. “We are getting married in the fall and are hoping to start a family shortly after,” she explains. Even though she won’t start trying for kids for a while, she’s planning ahead. “I wanted to be proactive and get some insight as to where we’re starting from,” says Christina.</p>



<h2 id="4-to-put-their-minds-at-ease">4. To put their minds at ease</h2>



<p>Laura has been trying to get pregnant since September 2019. “I&#8217;m 34, so my OB-GYN recommended that I check in with him after six months, and that was the plan,” she explains. Then… “Wham! We were quarantined for two weeks and on the day of our release, our state began its stay-at-home order.”</p>



<p>Laura started researching other options for learning more about her reproductive health without depending on the availability of in-person appointments. “When I found Modern Fertility, I thought it could be a good first step to understanding more about my fertility and putting my mind at ease,” she explains. “The fact that I could complete the test by myself and the only contact required was with the mailbox — it was the perfect solution!”</p>



<h2 id="what-you-get-with-the-modern-fertility-hormone-test">What you get with the Modern Fertility Hormone Test</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/product/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Fertility Hormone Test</a>&nbsp;measures the same hormones that traditional fertility clinics do — only at home, and for a fraction of the price. Depending on your birth control, you can test up to eight fertility hormones:&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/amh-levels-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-Mullerian hormone</a>&nbsp;(AMH),&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/thyroid-test-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid-stimulating hormone</a>&nbsp;(TSH),&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/estrogen-low-high" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estradiol</a>&nbsp;(E2, an estrogen),&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/fsh-hormone-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follicle-stimulating hormone</a>&nbsp;(FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH),&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/testosterone-levels-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testosterone</a>&nbsp;(T),&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/prolactin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prolactin</a>&nbsp;(P), and free thyroxine (fT4) if your TSH level suggests further testing would be helpful. (No matter what birth control you’re on, you can&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>test your AMH and TSH levels.)</p>



<p>What can you learn from looking at these hormone levels? Since there are many factors that play into how likely any of us is to conceive, no blood test can tell you&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/infertile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether or not you’re fertile</a>. But the Modern Fertility Hormone Test&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;give you important insight into your&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/amh-anti-mullerian-hormone-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian reserve</a>&nbsp;(how many eggs you have),&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/egg-freezing-cost-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential outcomes for egg freezing and in-vitro fertilization</a>&nbsp;(IVF), health conditions like&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/pcos-diagnosis-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polycystic ovary syndrome</a>&nbsp;(PCOS) and&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/thyroid-disorders-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid disorders</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://modernfertility.com/blog/track/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how your fertility is changing over time</a>. All of which can be incredibly useful when thinking about your timeline for kids.</p>
